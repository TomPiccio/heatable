# What exactly is HeaTable? 

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
HeaTable is a self-heating tray that can be stowed in airplane seats to enhance the dining experience during flight. This aftermarket product seeks to shorten the time it takes for Economy Class passengers to receive their heated lunch, ensuring that everyone on board receives a warm meal. 66% of 174 respondents to a research rated speedy in-flight food service as more important than having an abundance of in-flight meal selections. Not only will our prototype enhance the flight experience for Economy Class passengers, but it will also minimize cabin crew workload. 63.5% of cabin staff were fatigued and exhausted, according to a survey1, while another study2 indicated that weariness in cabin crew members was associated with the length of time awake and perceived excessive workload.
